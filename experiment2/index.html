				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>The goal of this assignment is to procedurally draw a scene using JavaScript and p5.js. The scene should be inspired by a reference image, and the code should be well-structured and easy to understand.
					The scene should appear to be "alive" and should be able to be reimagined upon regeneration.
					I used a reference image of a starry night sky as inspiration for this scene and set out try and simulate the same environment using p5.js.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p> This program works by utilizing the p5.js library to procedurally generate primitive shapes and vectors in order to create the desire scene. Seed generation was used to allow select predetermined 'random' function calls which vary during each seperate render. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p> I had a lot of fun with this project, though I had to research some p5.js functions especially the math operations. It was hard trying to simulate certain aspects of the original image such as the arch-shape of the upper sky shade, but with the proper research, I was able to accomplish this.</p>
