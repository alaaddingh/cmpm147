    <!-- DESCRIPTION -->
    <div class="minor-section">
      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        Two procedural generators were built with p5.js: an
        <em>over-world</em> biome map and a <em>dungeon</em> room-and-corridor
        map.  Each lives on its own page and can be opened with the buttons
        above.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- TECHNICAL -->
    <div class="minor-section">
      <h2>Technical</h2>
      <p>
        Both generators share the same 8 √ó 8-pixel tileset.  The over-world
        uses Perlin noise layers to assign biomes and animated water; the
        dungeon algorithm places non-overlapping <br> rooms and connects them with
        tunnels.  Putting each sketch on its own page avoids global callback
        collisions in p5.
      </p>

    <!-- REFLECTION -->
    <div class="minor-section">
      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>
		I spent a considerable amount of time just trying to get the two scenes to render on the same page, but opted for having them render on seperate html scripts. <br>
        Splitting the demos simplified debugging and guaranteed each sketch
        runs without having to juggle the DOM. I enjoyed this project and had to spend more time <br> on this one, especially with grasping the concept of noise.
